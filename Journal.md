Today I started the CAD for the robot. The plan going in was to maximize the size of the weapon while keeping everything as simple as possible. To accomplish this, I planned to use 3/8" UHMW frame rails, tangent drive, and an aluminum eggbeater driven by a custom hubmotor. The custom hubmotor eggbeater is the main focus of this project, as the rest of the robot is very generic and similar to many other four wheel drive eggbeaters.

To start, I laid out a master sketch from the top down view that contained where all of the main components would be located.

I also created a second master sketch from the side view. This sketch references dimensions in the first view and helps provide the basis for other parts in the robot that contain most of their features in this plane.

The first part I modeled was the uprights. These are the main structure of the robot as they keep the drive belts in tension, the rear wheel and the tangent drive shaft in compression, and keep the weapon rigidly attached. The uprights feature a pocket for the drive motor to sit in and for its wires to come out of and a pocket for the weapon shaft insert to sit in to prevent the holes in the UHMW uprights from ovalling out on big impacts. The uprights also feature holes for mounting the drive shafts, weapon motor, drive motors, fork standoffs, and the TPU front and back plates. The top and bottom of the uprights have holes for mounting the top and bottom plates with #4 plastite screws. The uprights feature partial pockets throuhgout the empty space of the part to reduce weight. The top front corner of the part has mounting for an "ear" that prevents the weapon from hitting the ground when upside down.

The left upright is a mirror image of the right upright that was shown first, except it includes through pockets for passing the weapon motor wires through into the frame.

The next part I designed was the top plate, which has mounting holes into the uprights and a standoff in the TPU front plate and TPU back plate. This ties the uprights together and is the main structure between the sides of the robot besides the weapon shaft.


The first issue in my desing process occured when I realized that the aluminum inserts that prevent the holes for the weapon shaft in the frame rails from ovalling out would stick out past the frame rail on the other side. This is a simple remedy if you have access to a mill or lathe. All you need to do is face 0.094" off of the round side.
