# Frostbite
Frostbite is a 1lb plastic antweight combat robot that focuses on being wide with a large weapon. Frostbite is meant to resemble my 15lb bot Subzero, but scaled down and simpler.

# Features

* Frostbite features a directly driven 88 gram PLA+ weapon on a Repeat 2822 weapon motor, powered by a BlHeliS ESC.
* Frostbite uses a tangent drive system for high speed and maneuverability, while saving space and weight.
* Frostbite's frame uses as few parts as possible and the entire bot can be printed in one print to maximize durability, simplicity, and ease of printing and assembly.
